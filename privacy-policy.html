        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> July 19, 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Papyrio collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile app and related services ("Service"). By using Papyrio, you consent to the practices described below.</p>

        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        <p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Data</strong> is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual</li>
            <li><strong>Service</strong> refers to the Papyrio mobile application</li>
            <li><strong>Company</strong> (referred to as "We", "Us" or "Our") refers to Papyrio LLC, 78 Cervantes Blvd Ste 1 San Francisco, CA 94123</li>
            <li><strong>Service Provider</strong> means any third-party company or individual employed by the Company to facilitate the Service</li>
            <li><strong>Affiliate</strong> means an entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Company</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data</strong> refers to data collected automatically when using the Service</li>
            <li><strong>Device</strong> means any device that can access the Service such as a computer, cellphone or digital tablet</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Account Information</h3>
        <p>When you create an account, we collect your email address and any optional profile information you provide.</p>

        <h3>Social Media Account Information</h3>
        <p>Papyrio allows you to create an account and log in through third-party social media services including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google</li>
            <li>Apple ID</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you choose to register through a social media service, we may collect personal data associated with your social media account, such as your name, email address, profile picture, and contact list associated with that account.</p>

        <h3>User Content</h3>
        <p>We collect any photos (including portraits and face images), story prompts, or other materials you upload or submit when using the app. This content is used to create personalized stories and artwork based on your submissions.</p>

        <h2>Use of Face Data</h2>
        <p>Papyrio values your privacy and is committed to handling personal information, including "face data," responsibly and transparently. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, "face data" refers only to the photographs that users voluntarily upload to the Papyrio app in order to generate illustrated characters. We do not collect, access, or use any biometric identifiers (such as Face ID templates, facial geometry, or landmark data from Apple's ARKit).</p>

        <h3>Why We Collect Face Data</h3>
        <p>We request user-uploaded photos containing faces solely for the purpose of generating customized illustrated characters in your personalized storybooks. These images are also used to enable our before-and-after feature, which lets you see the original photo side by side with the illustrated character. Face data is never used for authentication, profiling, marketing, or advertising purposes.</p>

        <h3>How Long We Store Face Data</h3>
        <p>Face data is retained only as long as the associated book exists in your account, up to a maximum of 12 months. This retention period is necessary so that you can continue to view the before-and-after feature of your books. After 12 months, or if you delete your book earlier, the uploaded photos are permanently deleted from our systems. We do not store face data indefinitely.</p>

        <h3>Sharing of Face Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Papyrio does not sell or share face data with advertisers, data brokers, or unrelated third parties.</li>
            <li>In order to provide our services, face data is processed by our contracted third-party cloud service providers (for example, AI model hosting and secure cloud storage).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why We Share Face Data with Third Parties</h3>
        <p>We share face data with these providers only to perform the image-to-illustration transformation service and to securely store your book. These providers act strictly as data processors on our behalf and do not use the data for their own purposes.</p>

        <h3>Third-Party Storage and Retention</h3>
        <p>Where third-party providers temporarily store face data to enable processing and hosting, they are contractually obligated to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the data only for the limited purpose of providing the Papyrio service.</li>
            <li>Protect the data using industry-standard security measures.</li>
            <li>Automatically delete the data in accordance with the same retention period we follow (up to 12 months, or sooner if the book is deleted).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not work with any third-party providers that permanently retain or repurpose user face data.</p>

        <h3>Payment Information</h3>
        <p>All payments are securely processed through Stripe. Papyrio does not store your credit card numbers or billing details.</p>

        <h3>Usage Data</h3>
        <p>We collect data about how you interact with the app, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Which features you use</li>
            <li>How many tokens you spend</li>
            <li>Which screens you visit</li>
            <li>Time and date of your visits</li>
            <li>Time spent on pages</li>
            <li>Unique device identifiers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Device & Technical Information</h3>
        <p>We may collect comprehensive technical information including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device type and operating system</li>
            <li>IP address (Internet Protocol address)</li>
            <li>Browser type and version</li>
            <li>Mobile device unique ID</li>
            <li>Mobile operating system</li>
            <li>Type of mobile Internet browser</li>
            <li>App crash logs and diagnostic data</li>

        <p>Some anonymized or aggregated data may be retained for analytics or service improvement purposes. Usage data is generally retained for a shorter period, except when used to strengthen security or improve functionality.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, including:</p>

        <p>Please note that we may need to retain certain information when we have a legal obligation or lawful basis to do so.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Papyrio is intended for use by individuals aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to create accounts or submit personal information directly.</p>
        <p>However, our services may involve content that features children. In such cases, the content must be submitted by a parent, guardian, or someone with appropriate rights and permissions.</p>
        <p>If we become aware that a child under 13 has created an account or submitted personal information without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information and terminate the account.</p>
        <p>If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing information and your country requires consent from a parent, we may require parental consent before we collect and use that information.</p>

        <h2>7. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>We take the security of your data seriously and implement reasonable safeguards to protect it from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration.</p>
        <p>However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information using commercially acceptable means, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>8. International Users and Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>If you access Papyrio from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States or other countries where we or our service providers operate.</p>
        <p>By using the app, you acknowledge that your data may be transferred to jurisdictions that may not provide the same level of data protection as your home country.</p>
        <p>We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. No transfer of your personal data will take place to an organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information.</p>

        <h2>9. Links to Other Websites</h2>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p>
        <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the app, by email, or by other reasonable means.</p>
        <p>The date of the latest revision will always be indicated at the top of the policy. Your continued use of the Service after any updates constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
        <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.</p>
