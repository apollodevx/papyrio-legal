        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Papyrio is a place where imagination is elegantly transformed into keepsakes — crafted just for you. These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the Papyrio mobile app and related services ("Service").</p>

        <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the App. By using Papyrio, you represent and warrant that you are at least 13 years of age and that you have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.</p>
        <p>If you are under 18, you may only use the App with the involvement and consent of a parent or guardian.</p>

        <h2>2. Use of the App</h2>
        <p>You agree to use Papyrio only for personal, non-commercial purposes and in accordance with these Terms and all applicable laws.</p>
        <p>You may not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use automated tools (such as bots or scrapers) to access or interact with the App.</li>
            <li>Sell, license, or redistribute content generated through the App for commercial purposes without prior written permission.</li>
            <li>Upload, submit, or use the App to generate content that is unlawful, harmful, abusive, harassing, defamatory, obscene, hateful, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
            <li>Infringe upon the rights of others, including intellectual property or privacy rights.</li>
            <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or interfere with the operation or security of the App.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Papyrio reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access if you violate these guidelines.</p>

        <h2>3. Purchases and Payments</h2>
        <p>Some features of Papyrio may require payment, including the purchase of digital tokens or physical products. All payments are securely processed through our third-party provider, Stripe, and are subject to their terms and conditions.</p>
        <p>Prices for products and services may change at any time. We reserve the right to update pricing and to correct pricing errors at our sole discretion.</p>
        <p>We may, in limited circumstances and at our discretion, offer refunds. If you believe you are entitled to a refund, please contact our support team. All refund decisions are final.</p>

        <h2>4. User Content</h2>
        <p>By using Papyrio, you may upload or submit content such as images, prompts, or other materials ("User Content").</p>
        <p>You retain ownership of your User Content. However, by submitting it through the App, you grant Papyrio a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, modify, store, and display your content solely to operate, improve, and provide the Service — including to train and enhance our AI models.</p>
        <p>You represent that you have all necessary rights to upload and share this content, and that it does not infringe the rights of any third party.</p>
        <p>Papyrio may remove or restrict access to any User Content that violates these Terms or is otherwise deemed inappropriate.</p>

        <h2>5. AI-Generated Content</h2>
        <p>Papyrio uses artificial intelligence to generate illustrations, stories, and other creative outputs based on your inputs. While we strive to deliver thoughtful and appropriate content, AI-generated material may occasionally contain inaccuracies, unexpected results, or content that is not suitable for all audiences.</p>
        <p>All generated content is provided "as is", and Papyrio makes no guarantees as to its accuracy, completeness, or suitability. You are solely responsible for how you interpret, use, or share the content created through the App.</p>
        <p>We recommend reviewing all outputs carefully before sharing them, especially with children or other sensitive audiences.</p>

        <h2>6. Privacy & Data</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. Please refer to our Privacy Policy to understand how we collect, use, and safeguard your personal information.</p>
        <p>By using Papyrio, you consent to the collection and use of your data as described in that policy.</p>

        <h2>7. Cancellation & Unsubscription</h2>
        <p><strong>Cancel Anytime.</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time through your device's subscription settings. Cancellation stops future renewals; however, you will retain access to AI Services until the end of your current billing period. No partial refunds are provided for unused time.</p>
        <p><strong>How to Cancel:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Apple (iOS):</strong> Manage or cancel your subscription through Apple App Store Subscriptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Android (Google Play):</strong> Manage or cancel your subscription through Google Play Subscriptions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>End of Access.</strong> Once the billing period ends, your subscription will not renew and your access to AI Services will end unless you resubscribe.</p>

        <h2>8. Fair-Use Limits on AI Services</h2>
        <p><strong>AI Usage Limits.</strong> Your subscription includes access to AI-powered services ("AI Services"), which are subject to fair-use restrictions. We may enforce limits on usage—such as the number of messages, tokens, requests, or generated books—on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, depending on your subscription tier.</p>
        <p><strong>Fair-Use of Generated Books.</strong> Papyrio's book-generation tools are intended for personal, educational, or business use within reasonable limits. Automated mass production, resale of generated books, or excessively large volumes of requests are prohibited.</p>
        <p><strong>Prohibited Conduct.</strong> You may not attempt to circumvent usage limits or use automated methods (e.g., bots, scripts, or reselling accounts) that degrade the quality of the Service.</p>
        <p><strong>Enforcement Actions.</strong> Breaching usage limits or misusing AI Services may result in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Temporary restriction or suspension of access to AI Services</li>
            <li>Permanent account deactivation</li>
            <li>Other measures at our discretion</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Notification.</strong> You will be notified if limits are reached or enforcement action is taken. If you believe the action is in error, you may contact support.</p>
        <p><strong>Policy Updates.</strong> We reserve the right to adjust usage limits or enforcement practices at any time to ensure fairness and service quality.</p>

        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to Papyrio at any time, without prior notice or liability, if we reasonably believe that you have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Violated these Terms</li>
            <li>Engaged in fraudulent, abusive, or harmful behavior</li>
            <li>Misused the App in a way that affects others or the service itself</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may also stop using the App at any time. Termination does not limit any rights or remedies available to Papyrio under law or equity.</p>

        <h2>10. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Papyrio is provided "as is" and "as available", without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.</p>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Papyrio and its affiliates, officers, employees, or partners shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or goodwill, arising from your use of or inability to use the App.</p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability, so parts of this section may not apply to you.</p>

        <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law principles. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Delaware for the resolution of any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the App.</p>
